My work learning how to use Python for deep learning and other data science applications

Most of the model training is run on the Google Compute Engine on a Ubuntu 16.04 VM powered by 16 vCPUs and two NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs.

This repository will gradually contain more notebooks showing my attempts to learn how to use pandas, numpy, and libraries for machine/deep learning like keras, tensorflow, and pytorch.
